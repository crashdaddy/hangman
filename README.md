Hang Man Instructions

    First build this project in the terminal 
            -- we made the terminal version and the html
            version in the same code, so that if you're playing
            the html version and press f12 to activate the console
            you can see the terminal version as well!
    Then attach it to the DOM
            -- here's a live version: https://www.crazyhappyfuntime.com/hangman/
